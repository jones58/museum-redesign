Redesigning the website for the National Museum of Computing.

## Why Redesign?

I decided to have a go at redesigning the website for the National Museum of Computing in Bletchley Park. Before a recent visit, I went to book tickets and was quite disappointed:

- Basic site design: The site is not very well designed, lacking in clear branding, navigation and messaging. This is not very appealing to prospective visitors, especially young people like myself.
- Mixture of fonts: the site uses Arial and Proxima Nova, both of which are poor choices in my opinion.
- Hosted on Squarespace: Site should not be built and hosted on Squarespace - it has high fees and is hard to create a custom looking site on. A site built in React would be better. A CMS (like Wordpress) would allow us to provide easily updateable content.
  - Squarespace sites are normally associated with poor performance, too. This was confirmed when I ran Google Lighthouse on the site and received a performance score of just 28.
- Confusing navigation: The navigation is not well organised and lacks clarity.

  - on mobile, the hamburger icon should change to an X when clicked, to close the menu.

- Text heavy design: The website is very heavy on text, particular on the homepage when viewed on mobile.
- Calls to action: The landing page could do with some clearer calls to action to encourage visitors to explore the site, volunteer, or donate to the museum.
- Accessibility: The site lacks several accessibility features. It receives a score of 88 on Google Lighthouse, which while not the worst, could easily be improved with some small changes such as not using green text on a white background (lacks sufficient contrast)

## Planning

- I found examples of museum websites and designs I liked and gathered them on Are.na, and then a Figma board.
- Using the information and pieces above as a guide, I set about redesigning the site in Figma.
