Redesigning the website for the National Museum of Computing.

## Why Redesign?

I decided to have a go at redesigning the website for the National Museum of Computing in Bletchley Park. I noticed the site was lacking in a few areas when I went to book tickets for a recent visit.

- Basic site design: The site is not very well designed, lacking in clear branding, navigation and messaging.
- Mixture of fonts: the site uses Arial and Proxima Nova, both of which are poor choices in my opinion.
- Hosted on Squarespace: Site should not be built and hosted on Squarespace - it has high fees and is hard to create a custom looking site on. A site built in React would be better. A backend built on Wordpress CMS or such would provide easily updateable content.
- Confusing navigation: The navigation is not well organised and lacks clarity.

  - on mobile, the hamburger icon should change to an X when clicked, to close the menu.

- Text heavy design: The website is very heavy on text, particular on the homepage when viewed on mobile.
- Lacking calls to action: The landing page could do with some clear calls to action to encourage visitors to explore the site, volunteer, or donate to the museum.

## Planning

- Include calls to action: What do you want visitors to do after they've explored your website? Consider adding calls to action, such as "Donate Now" or "Plan Your Visit."
